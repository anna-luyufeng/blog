## DOM (Document Object Model)

Describes the document structure, manipulations and events

`document`

### CSSOM (CSS Object Model)

???

In practice though, CSSOM is rarely required, because we rarely need to modify CSS rules from JavaScript (usually we just add/remove CSS classes, not modify their CSS rules), but thatâ€™s also possible.

## BOM (Browser Object Model)

- `navigator`
  - `navigator.userAgent`
  - `navigator.platform `

- `location`
- `alert/confirm/prompt`
