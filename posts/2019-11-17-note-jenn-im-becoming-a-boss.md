# 5 Pillars

## Self Reflect
Ask yourself basic questions
   - What's your business?
   - What will it look like in 5 years?
   - Why did you start this?
## Manage your mind
   - Your brain is the biggest asset you have
   - I feel like managing your mind can determine your success as an entrepreneur but it also determines every aspect of your life

 ### Plan ahead
- everyday we're overwhelmed with so many decisions: decision fatigue
- create your rules and stick to them
### Build your willpower
- Do not be that flaky-ass friend
- If you say you're gonna do something, freaking do it.
- You need to PRIORITIZE your time. You need to be efficient with your time.
- your willpower is a muscle

### Set a timer for 20 min
- First, set the timer for 20 minutes
- focus on the task at hand
- Even if you don't finish it on time, it like allows me to gauge how long it takes me to do something.

## Invest in yourself
1. Therapy 
   - normalize therapy
   - Everybody needs therapy 
   - we can all use an avenue where we can express

2. Exercise
   - stabilize mood
   - It allows me to center myself when I am working
   - Being sedentary is not serving you anyway
   - getting that energy out

3. Absorb soul-fulfilling material
   - look for it
   - boss bible: Steve Covey's The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People
   - reading, podcast

They are commitments.
Think of all the random stuff that you spend your money on that are temporary and superficial.

**Why not spend it on your physical and mental health?**

## Be uncomfortable
- The only way I was able to get comfortable with it is by confronting it.
- delegate
- I wouldn't have been able to grow if I didn't stay comfortable.

## Be empathetic and gentle with yourself
- I was in a toxic relationship with myself
- **Treat yourself like someone you care about**
- Why wouldn't I find simple happiness in my own achievements?
- when you are gentle and empathetic with yourself, it reflects on the people that are around you.
- BDV, boss diva energy

**Be the boss of your own life.**
